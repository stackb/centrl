config_settings≈	Config settings to change for this target.

The keys are labels for settings, and the values are strings for the new value
to use. Pass `Label` objects or canonical label strings for the keys to ensure
they resolve as expected (canonical labels start with `@@` and can be
obtained by calling `str(Label(...))`).

Most `@rules_python//python/config_setting` settings can be used here, which
allows, for example, making only a certain `py_binary` use
{obj}`--boostrap_impl=script`.

Additional or custom config settings can be registered using the
{obj}`add_transition_setting` API. This allows, for example, forcing a
particular CPU, or defining a custom setting that `select()` uses elsewhere
to pick between `pip.parse` hubs. See the [How to guide on multiple
versions of a library] for a more concrete example.

:::{note}
These values are transitioned on, so will affect the analysis graph and the
associated memory overhead. The more unique configurations in your overall
build, the more memory and (often unnecessary) re-analysis and re-building
can occur. See

 experimental_venvs_site_packages∑**INTERNAL ATTRIBUTE. SHOULD ONLY BE SET BY rules_python-INTERNAL CODE.**

:::{include} /_includes/experimental_api.md
:::

A flag that decides whether the library should treat its sources as a
site-packages layout.

When the flag is `yes`, then the `srcs` files are treated as a site-packages
layout that is relative to the `imports` attribute. The `imports` attribute
can have only a single element. It is a repo-relative runfiles path.

For example, in the `my/pkg/BUILD.bazel` file, given
`srcs=["site-packages/foo/bar.py"]`, specifying
`imports=["my/pkg/site-packages"]` means `foo/bar.py` is the file path
under the binary's venv site-packages directory that should be made available (i.e.
`import foo.bar` will work).

`__init__.py` files are treated specially to provide basic support for [implicit
namespace packages](
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages).
However, the *content* of the files cannot be taken into account, merely their
presence or absence. Stated another way: [pkgutil-style namespace packages](
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages)
won't be understood as namespace packages; they'll be seen as regular packages. This will
likely lead to conflicts with other targets that contribute to the namespace.

toolchain configured to match the Python version. If there isn't, then it
may be silently ignored, or an error may occur, depending on the toolchain
configuration.

other_rules.py_runtimeÉ	Represents a Python runtime used to execute Python code.

A `py_runtime` target can represent either a *platform runtime* or an *in-build
runtime*. A platform runtime accesses a system-installed interpreter at a known
path, whereas an in-build runtime points to an executable target that acts as
the interpreter. In both cases, an "interpreter" means any executable binary or
wrapper script that is capable of running a Python script passed on the command
line, following the same conventions as the standard CPython interpreter.

A platform runtime is by its nature non-hermetic. It imposes a requirement on
the target platform to have an interpreter located at a specific path. An
in-build runtime may or may not be hermetic, depending on whether it points to
a checked-in interpreter or a wrapper script that accesses the system
interpreter.

Example

```
load("@rules_python//python:py_runtime.bzl", "py_runtime")

py_runtime(
    name = "python-2.7.12",
    files = glob(["python-2.7.12/**"]),
    interpreter = "python-2.7.12/bin/python",
)

py_runtime(
    name = "python-3.6.0",
    interpreter_path = "/opt/pyenv/versions/3.6.0/bin/python",
)
```*
nameA unique name for this target. w
	abi_flags^The runtime's ABI flags, i.e. `sys.abiflags`.

If not set, then it will be set based on flags.2"<AUTO>"∑
bootstrap_templateÍThe bootstrap script template file to use. Should have %python_binary%,
%workspace_name%, %main%, and %imports%.

This template, after expansion, becomes the executable file used to start the
process, so it is responsible for initial bootstrapping actions such as finding
the Python interpreter, runfiles, and constructing an environment to run the
intended Python application.

While this attribute is currently optional, it will become required when the
Python rules are moved out of Bazel itself.

The exact variable names expanded is an unstable API and is subject to change.
The API will become more stable when the Python rules are moved out of Bazel
itself.

See @bazel_tools//tools/python:python_bootstrap_template.txt for more variables.22"@rules_python//python/private:bootstrap_template"µ
coverage_toolõThis is a target to use for collecting code coverage information from
{rule}`py_binary` and {rule}`py_test` targets.

If set, the target must either produce a single file or be an executable target.
The path to the single file, or the executable if the target is executable,
determines the entry point for the python coverage tool.  The target and its
runfiles will be added to the runfiles when coverage is enabled.

The entry point for the tool must be loadable by a Python interpreter (e.g. a
`.py` or `.pyc` file).  It must accept the command line arguments
of [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io), at least including
the `run` and `lcov` subcommands.2NoneÂ
files’For an in-build runtime, this is the set of files comprising this runtime.
These files will be added to the runfiles of Python binaries that use this
runtime. For a platform runtime this attribute must not be set.2[]^
implementation_name:The Python implementation name (`sys.implementation.name`)2	"cpython"≤
interpreteröFor an in-build runtime, this is the target to invoke as the interpreter. It
can be either of:

* A single file, which will be the interpreter binary. It's assumed such
  interpreters are either self-contained single-file executables or any
  supporting files are specified in `files`.
* An executable target. The target's executable will be the interpreter binary.
  Any other default outputs (`target.files`) and plain files runfiles
  (`runfiles.files`) will be automatically included as if specified in the
  `files` attribute.

  NOTE: the runfiles of the target may not yet be properly respected/propagated
  to consumers of the toolchain/interpreter, see
  bazel-contrib/rules_python/issues/1612

For a platform runtime (i.e. `interpreter_path` being set) this attribute must
not be set.2None¥
interpreter_pathôFor a platform runtime, this is the absolute path of a Python interpreter on
the target platform. For an in-build runtime this attribute must not be set.2""Ó
interpreter_version_infoÀVersion information about the interpreter this runtime provides.

If not specified, uses {obj}`--python_version`

The supported keys match the names for `sys.version_info`. While the input
values are strings, most are converted to ints. The supported keys are:
  * major: int, the major version number
  * minor: int, the minor version number
  * micro: optional int, the micro version number
  * releaselevel: optional str, the release level
  * serial: optional int, the serial number of the release

:::{versionchanged} 0.36.0
{obj}`--python_version` determines the default value.

pyc_tag±Optional string; the tag portion of a pyc filename, e.g. the `cpython-39` infix
of `foo.cpython-39.pyc`. See PEP 3147. If not specified, it will be computed
from `implementation_name` and `interpreter_version_info`. If no pyc_tag is
available, then only source-less pyc generation will function correctly.2""õ
python_versionˇWhether this runtime is for Python major version 2 or 3. Valid values are `"PY2"`
and `"PY3"`.

The default value is controlled by the `--incompatible_py3_is_default` flag.
However, in the future this attribute will be mandatory and have no default
value.2"PY3"«

interpreter at startup.
